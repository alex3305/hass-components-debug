# Home Assistant - custom components (debug)

This repository holds my debug versions of some custom components that I am
working on. I cannot guarantee that these versions are up to date in any way.
Also most of this code are licensed by their respectful owners. These 
modifications are just for testing and should not be used.

## Usage

You can place these components in the `custom_components` directory of Home
Asisstant. After a restart they should automatically be picked up. For easy
access, you can download a ZIP file from this repo for testing.
